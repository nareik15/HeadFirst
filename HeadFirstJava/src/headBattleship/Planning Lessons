Planning Lessons: Chapter 4 (improvements to the solution I was intending)

-Build a simplified version of main program first either to scale up later or use knowledge of small program to plan and build a larger one.
-in keeping with simple version, perhaps limit "futureproofing" (trying to program simpmle version with maximal extensibility in mind. Build small and refactor where necessary(
	-(of course, no magic numbers...)

- game state need not be fully realised in code. 
	-rather than represent 7x7 battleship grid in a 2d array, 
	-instead store battleship locations and use closed-world assumption(i.e. all non-defined locations assumed empty)
	-Ensuring that inputs are valid by filtering inputs rather that checking for 2d array lookup errors.
	
	- much more memory efficient.
	-(SIDENOTE: the problem of populating a 7x7 grid with ships randomly mays still be interesting to solve using "myBattleship" method)
